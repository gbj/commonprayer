[Refrain]\n\n3 Not a burden we bear,\nNot a sorrow we share,\nBut our toil He doth richly repay;\nNot a grief nor a loss,\nNot a frown nor a cross,\nBut is blest if we trust and obey. (refrain)\n\n4 But we never can prove\nThe delights of His love\nUntil all on the altar we lay;\nFor the favor He shows,\nAnd the joy He bestows,\nAre for them who will trust and obey. [Refrain]\n\n5 When in fellowship sweet\nWe will sit at His feet,\nOr we’ll walk by His side in the way;\nWhat He says we will do,\nWhere He sends we will go,\nNever fear, only trust and obey.
