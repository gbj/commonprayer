And let them turn to the Lord,\nand he will have compassion,\nand to our God, for he will richly pardon.\n\n4. For my thoughts are not our thoughts,\nnor your ways my ways, says the Lord.\n\n5. For as the heavens are higher than the earth,\nso are my ways higher than your ways,\nand my thoughts than your thoughts.\n\n6. For as rain and snow fall from the heavens\nand return not again, but water the earth,\n\n7. Bringing forth life and giving growth,\nseed for sowing and bread for eating,\n\n8. So it is my word that goes forth\nfrom my mouth;\nit will not return to me empty;\n\n9. But it will accomplish that \nwhich I have purposed,\nand prosper in that for which I sent it.\n\nGlory be to the Father, and to the Son,\nand to the Holy Spirit:\nAs it was in the beginning, is now,\nand will be for ever. Amen.",

Once in royal Davidâs city \nstood a lowly cattle shed, \nwhere a mother laid her baby \nin a manger for his bed: \nMary was that mother mild, \nJesus Christ her little child. \n\n2. He came down to earth from heaven, \nwho is God and Lord of all, \nand his shelter was a stable, \nand his cradle was a stall; \nwith the poor, the scorned, the lowly, \nlived on earth our Savior holy. \n\n3. [Protected by copyright]\n\n4. For he is our lifelong pattern; \ndaily, when on earth he grew, \nhe was tempted, scorned, rejected,  \ntears and smiles like us he knew.\nThus he feels for all our sadness, \nand he shares in all our gladness. \n\n5. And our eyes at last shall see him, \nthrough his own redeeming love; \nfor that child who seemed so helpless \nis our Lord in heaven above; \nand he leads his children on \nto the place where he is gone.\n\n6. Not in that poor lowly stable,\nwith the oxen standing round,\nwe shall see him; but in heaven,\nwhere his saints his throne surround:\nChrist, revealed to faithful eye,\nset a Godâs right hand on high.\n",

Blessed feasts of blessed martyrs,\nholy women, holy men,\nwith affectionâs recollections\ngreet we your return again.\nWorthy deeds they wrought, and wonders,\nworthy of the Name they bore;\nwe, with meetest praise and sweetest,\nhonor them for evermore.\n\n2. Faith prevailing, hope unfailing,\nloving Christ with single heart,\nthus they, glorious and victorious\nbravely bore the martyrâs part,\nby contempt of every anguish,\nby unyielding battle done;\nvictors at the last, they triumph\nwith the host of angels one.\n\n3. Therefore, ye that reign in glory,\nfellow-heirs with Christ on high,\njoin to ours your supplication\nwhen before him we draw nigh,\npraying that, this life completed,\nall its fleeting moments past,\nby his grace we may be worthy\nof eternal bliss at last.\n",
