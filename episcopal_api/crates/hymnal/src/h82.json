And let them turn to the Lord,\nand he will have compassion,\nand to our God, for he will richly pardon.\n\n4. For my thoughts are not our thoughts,\nnor your ways my ways, says the Lord.\n\n5. For as the heavens are higher than the earth,\nso are my ways higher than your ways,\nand my thoughts than your thoughts.\n\n6. For as rain and snow fall from the heavens\nand return not again, but water the earth,\n\n7. Bringing forth life and giving growth,\nseed for sowing and bread for eating,\n\n8. So it is my word that goes forth\nfrom my mouth;\nit will not return to me empty;\n\n9. But it will accomplish that \nwhich I have purposed,\nand prosper in that for which I sent it.\n\nGlory be to the Father, and to the Son,\nand to the Holy Spirit:\nAs it was in the beginning, is now,\nand will be for ever.

Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,\nwho heard the angelic herald’s voice: “Behold,\nI bring good tidings of a Savior’s birth\nto you and all the nations on the earth:\nthis day hath God fulfilled his promised word,\nthis day is born a Savior, Christ the Lord.”\n\n3. He spoke, and straightway the celestial choir\nin hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire;\nthe praises of redeeming love they sang,\nand heaven’s whole orb with alleluias rang;\nGod’s highest glory was their anthem still,\npeace on the earth, and unto men good will.\n\n4. In Bethlehem the happy shepherds sought\nto see the wonder God for us had wrought,\nand found, with Joseph and the blessed maid,\nher Son, the Savior, in a manger laid;\namazed, the wondrous story they proclaim,\nthe earliest heralds of the Savior’s name.\n\n5. Let us, like these good shepherds, then employ\nour grateful voices to proclaim the joy;\ntrace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss,\nfrom his poor manger to his bitter cross;\ntreading his steps, assisted by his grace, \ntill our first heavenly state again takes place.\n\n6. Then may we hope, the angelic thrones among,\nto sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song;\nhe that was born upon this joyful day\naround us all his glory shall display;\nsaved by his love, incessant we shall sing\neternal praise to heaven’s almighty King.
